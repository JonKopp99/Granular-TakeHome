For this take-home project, you’ll be creating a simple iOS app in Swift that displays a list of numbers and images.

Using this mock endpoint, the app should fetch the data, store it in an on-device database, then display it in a list. For each entry, it should display the image referenced (one for example) on the left-hand side and display the name on the right-hand side, in the order that it is listed in the JSON response.

Optional but not required features:

Display a placeholder image while downloading the image
Prioritization for downloading images that are currently on-screen
Cache the images to avoid unnecessary downloads
Unit tests
Any other neat ideas you have time for!
Our goal is to use this project to see your personal coding style, familiarity with design patterns, and your ability to architect simple iOS functionality. We’ll also use it as a conversation starter for future sessions. We want to be respectful of your time, so please limit your work to 3 hours. Please only use a third-party library for your network stack. All other dependencies should be part of the iOS platform.

Please follow standard best practices and record your work using git. Once you’re done with the project we ask that you please create a new private repo, upload it to GitHub and invite user granulartechnical. GitHub now provides unlimited free private repos but if you have any trouble, please let us know.
